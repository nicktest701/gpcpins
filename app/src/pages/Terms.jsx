        </h2>
        <p className='content'>
          Visiting the Services, sending us emails, and completing online forms
          constitute electronic communications. You consent to receive
          electronic communications, and you agree that all agreements, notices,
          disclosures, and other communications we provide to you
          electronically, via email and on the Services, satisfy any legal
          requirement that such communication be in writing. YOU HEREBY AGREE TO
          THE USE OF ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES, CONTRACTS, ORDERS, AND OTHER
          RECORDS, AND TO ELECTRONIC DELIVERY OF NOTICES, POLICIES, AND RECORDS
          OF TRANSACTIONS INITIATED OR COMPLETED BY US OR VIA THE SERVICES. You
          hereby waive any rights or requirements under any statutes,
          regulations, rules, ordinances, or other laws in any jurisdiction
          which require an original signature or delivery or retention of
          non-electronic records, or to payments or the granting of credits by
          any means other than electronic means.

        <h2 id='miscellaneous'>23. MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
        <p className='content'>
          These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us on
          the Services or in respect to the Services constitute the entire
          agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to
          exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Legal Terms shall
          not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Legal Terms
          operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or
          all of our rights and obligations to others at any time. We shall not
          be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to
          act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any
          provision or part of a provision of these Legal Terms is determined to
          be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the
          provision is deemed severable from these Legal Terms and does not
          affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
          There is no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency
          relationship created between you and us as a result of these Legal
          Terms or use of the Services. You agree that these Legal Terms will
          not be construed against us by virtue of having drafted them. You
          hereby waive any and all defences you may have based on the electronic
          form of these Legal Terms and the lack of signing by the parties
          hereto to execute these Legal Terms.
